                Wakatsuki Takeshi (若わか槻つき 武たけ士し; "Takeshi Wakatsuki"), also known as The Wild Tiger (猛もう虎こ, Mōko), is the affiliated fighter of Furumi Pharmaceuticals; he represented the company during the Kengan Annihilation Tournament. Takeshi is the longest-serving active affiliated Kengan fighter and has the highest win record of all affiliated fighters. Two years later he entered the Kengan Association VS Purgatory Tournament as a representative of the Kengan Association.            </p>

                    Takeshi is a powerfully imposing individual with dense well-defined musculature. He has short blonde hair, thick blonde facial hair on his chin, dark eyebrows, a chiselled cheek structure and discerning eyes. Takeshi tends to wear tight-fitting tops that accentuate his already muscular frame, as well as simple pants and footwear to finish off his outfits.

                <li><p>
                    Takeshi is quiet, yet easy to befriend. He's highly analytical, making observations some people wouldn't notice. When fighting, he's incredibly ferocious, according to his ephithet, but will change his strategy at the last minute if needed. This was shown during his battle with Julius, where he took all of Julius's blows, then defeated him with a vicious kick to the head, after he deduced he couldn't win through body strikes. He values strength above most other things, though he is also humble and modest, and honestly admits to being nervous when entering a fight. Despite his calm-and-collected personality, Takeshi is surprisingly sloppy.

                <li><span>History</span></li>
                <li><p>
                    Takeshi was different from the moment he was born, having a birth weight of 12150g, due to his body's abnormally high muscle density. He was unable to live a normal life because of his condition, and lived inside Furumi Pharmaceuticals' secret laboratory until the age of seven, when his future employer Furumi Heihachi helped him learn to regulate his strength by encouraging him to punch him as hard as he could. As a child, he sent five judo club members to the hospital after they picked a fight with him, without taking a single scratch himself.
