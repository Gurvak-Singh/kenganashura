            <p>Kure Raian (呉くれ 雷らい庵あん), also known as The Devil (魔ま人じん, Majin)[5], is an assassin from the infamous Kure Clan. He represented Under Mount, Inc. as their affiliated fighter during the Kengan Annihilation Tournament and was one of the three assassins in the tournament. Two years later, he fought in the Kengan Association VS Purgatory Tournament, representing the Kengan Association.</p>

                    Appearance
                </span></li>
                <li><p>Raian is a muscular man of above-average height. He has short, spiked light blond hair with a small widow's peak and a notch on his hairline's right side. As a member of the Kure Clan, he has dark scelera eyes. He bears a passing resemblance to the current clan patriarch, Kure Erioh, during his youth.</p></li>

                    Personality
                </span></li>
                <li><p>
                    Raian is a violent and psychopathic man who cares for little more than domination, violence, and killing. He does not seem to bear any remorse for his violent actions, and in fact, appears to relish in it. He speaks aggressively and often with profanity. He also does not seem to enjoy or care for camaraderie or festive social events, seeing as how he derisively dismissed his clan's farewell party for Ohma Tokita as "kumbaya shit."
                </p></li>
                <li><span>History</span></li>
                <li><p>On the S.S. Kengan, Raian found the situation audibly humorous when Kure Karura returned and revealed she had a crush on someone. With Erioh incensed by her falling for Ohma, Raian laughed his head off before telling his grandfather to calm down as he was releasing his "restraints". Later, Erioh confirmed with the group that Raian would represent Under Mount, Inc. in the upcoming tournament, causing Raian to exclaim excitedly that he would kill everyone.</p></li>
