            <p>Kaolan Wongsawat (ガオラン・ウォンサワット, Gaoran Wonsawatto), also known as The Thai God of War (タイの闘とう神しん, Tai no Tōshin), is a renowned boxer and current heavyweight champion across four different organizations, as well as the personal bodyguard of Rama XIII. A nak muay who made the move into the professional boxing scene, Kaolan has made it as the second best Pound-for-pound boxer in history. During the Kengan Annihilation Tournament, he participated as the affiliated fighter for Yato Trading Co. Two years later, he entered the Kengan Association VS Purgatory Tournament as a representative for the Kengan Association.</p>

                <li><p>Kaolan is a highly-built man of Thai descent with long straight black hair tied into a ponytail that hangs over his left shoulder, thin discerning eyes, and a small circlet around his crown. Despite being a heavyweight boxer, Kaolan possesses a smaller frame compared to most of his contemporaries.</p></li>

                    His most obvious motivation is, in truth, derived from his extreme patriotism to Thailand and loyalty to his ruler, Rama XIII. In fact, Kaolan would have not taken part in the Annihilation Tournament at all without Rama XIII's command, disparaging the tournament for being a mere freak show in comparison to the purity of conflict in something like boxing. Despite this, he came to greatly respect Kaneda Suekichi's determination and willpower during their fight, calling him a true warrior.

                <li><span>History</span></li>
                <li><p>Kaolan started his fighting career as a nak muay 20 years ago when the King of Thailand, Rama XII, noticed his talents, soon earning the name "Thai God of War" after becoming the greatest Nak muay. At the age of 15, Kaolan joined the annual cross-border match between Myanmar and Thailand. There, he encountered Yoroizuka Saw Paing for the first time and defeated him by judge's decision in their fight. Since then, Saw Paing proceeded to constantly challenge him to a rematch, even crossing the border to do so.</p></li>
