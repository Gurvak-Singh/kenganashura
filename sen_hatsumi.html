                Hatsumi Sen (初はつ見み 泉せん; "Sen Hatsumi"), also known as The Floating Cloud (浮うき雲ぐも, Ukigumo), is an affiliated fighter within the Kengan matches. He represented the Nogi Group during the Kengan Annihilation Tournament.

                    Hatsumi has long black hair that he lets fall down his back, thin black eyebrows, relaxed eyes, pronounced tear-troughs and thin stubble above his lip and on his chin. He usually has a casual style of dress.

                <li><p>
                    Hatsumi is an extremely relaxed and blasé person. This lackadaisical attitude shows in most of his Kengan losses: nine by oversleeping, four from bailing and two from forgetting there was a match on. However, when he gets serious, he gets serious. Hatsumi is also a known womaniser who has an issue with keeping it in his pants, so some consider him nothing but a lech. His characterisation is like an elusive floating cloud.

                <li><span>History</span></li>
                <li><p>
                    Eighteen years ago, in his early 20s, Hatsumi first met and soon started dating Soryuin Shion for the first time. During that time, he took Shion to Tochigi Destiny Land, but they had a fight and broke up afterwards because she caught him cheating. Two years after they first started dating, Hatsumi left again, telling Shion he was going on a journey to fight powerful fighters, but Shion realised the truth when she picked up an adult tour programe that he had dropped. He then left Japan to travel the world and fight in several underground matches to train himself (and enjoy the company of women).
