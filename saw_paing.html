                    Saw Paing is a Burmese fighter with a lean and tall physique. He arguably appears much younger than he is, with a youthful and hairless face and spiky, voluminous brown hair and hazel eyes. True to his personality, he often sports a determined and enthusiastic expression with wide eyes and a perpetual grin.

                    Saw Paing is the polar opposite of his self-proclaimed rival, Kaolan Wongsawat; while the latter is calm and apathetic, Saw Paing is hot-blooded, brash, and easily excitable. He is a frequent shouter and yells loud enough to drown out the announcer on the mic in a crowded stadium. His adoptive father, Sanemitsu, casually states that Saw Paing is not a very intelligent person, though he does have (a certain degree of) common sense. Despite his hot-blooded nature, Saw Paing is surprisingly understanding, such as delaying fights with Kaolan if the latter has an appointment.

                <li><p>
                    At the age of 16, Saw Paing participated in the annual cross-border match between Myanmar and Thailand. There, he encountered Kaolan for the first time and was defeated in their fight by judge's decision.
