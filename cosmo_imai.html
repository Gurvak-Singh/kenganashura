            <p>Imai Cosmo (今いま井い コスモ, Imai Kosumo), also known as The King of Stranglers (絞こう殺さつ王おう, Kōsatsu-ō), is one of the affiliated fighters employed for Nishihonji Security Services. He represented Nishihonji Security Services during the Kengan Annihilation Tournament.</p>

                </span></li>
                <li><p>Cosmo is a young man of average height, though possesses a well-defined build, as expected for an affiliate fighter. Cosmo's blond hair was first styled as a bob cut, favoring it even when he was 17. During moments of duress, he has shown the tendency to swipe his hair back and don an intense expression.</p></li>

                <li><p>
                    Cosmo tends to take risks during the fighting, and combined with the fact that his fighting style revolves around submission holds rather than blows, he often ends up coming out of his fights more badly injured than his opponent, even when he wins. While he claims to enjoy fighting for fighting's own sake and does seem to enjoy the thrill of the fight; it is not until he is nearly killed by Akoya Seishu that he realizes that this is not a love of fighting, but a strong desire to win.

                <li><span>History</span></li>
                <li><p>As a child, Cosmo was getting into fights on the streets day in and day out, until he met Kureishi Mitsuyo, a mixed martial artist who offered to teach him martial arts. Cosmo proved to be a natural at it, so much so that when one of Kureishi's other students, a young businessman named Nishihonji Akira, came to recruit Kureishi to fight for his business, Kureishi instead referred him to Cosmo.</p></li>
