                Kiryu Setsuna (桐き生りゅう 刹せつ那な, Kiryū Setsuna; "Setsuna Kiryu"), also known as The Beautiful Beast (美び獣じゅう, Bijū), is a mysterious individual whose history is closely intertwined with Tokita Ohma's. He was the affiliated fighter for the Koyo Academy Group during the most recent Kengan Annihilation Tournament. Two years after the Tournament, he suddenly reappears interacting with Gaoh Ryuki.

                    Kiryu is an effeminate-looking young man with long black hair that falls down his back and frames his face in two long bangs, gentle livid-colored eyes and he has an incredibly defined musculature.

                    Outwardly, Kiryu is a very polite and friendly person, belying his true obsessive nature directed towards Tokita Ohma, with an irrational hatred towards Tokita Niko. While his obsession in Ohma initially appears to be sadomasochistic and sexual, it's more of religious fervor: He worships Ohma as a god who will give him destruction and loathes Niko as the devil who defiled his god. Kiryu also suffered a severe form of psychosis due to overusing the Fallen Demon technique, causing him to hallucinate that Niko is still alive and taking the form of different people and that he must kill Niko in every form he takes.

                    Two years later, Kiryu returned to the Inside and found Ohma once again. Accosting Ohma, Kiryu forcibly activated the Possessing Spirit after it was bestowed upon him by The Other Niko, causing him to violently rampage. Ohma nearly killed Kiryu but was stopped at the last minute by the arrival of Tokita Niko. With Niko stopping Ohma's rampage, Kiryu then watched as Niko fought The Other Niko.
