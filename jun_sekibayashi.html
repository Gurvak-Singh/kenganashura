                    Sekibayashi is a proud professional wrestler who takes his occupation very seriously, maintaining that as a wrestler it is his responsibility to tank any and all damage that comes his way. To that end, he fights with entertaining the audience as his first goal and defeating his opponent the second.

                <li><p>
                    Born Sekibayashi Junpei, Sekibyashi was a delinquent for his teen years with no manners to speak of. Grown prideful and aggressive from never being beaten, he soon chose to join Super Japan Pro Wrestling at the age of 15 after picking and losing a fight with its chairman, Babadozan Hiroshi, to the point where he was "within an inch of his life", though his spirit made Babadozan come to like him. After that experience, Sekibayashi was put through a gruelling training regimen and diet. His fatigue at points where he would regularly and violently vomit his food. Six months after his training, the twenty people that joined along with Sekibayashi had now been reduced to four. Babadozan then invited him to dinner and christened Sekibayashi with his ring name "Hell's Angel" Sekibayashi Jun, a name Sekibayashi initially found thoughtless.
