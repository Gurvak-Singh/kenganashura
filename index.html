            <p>Tokita Ohma (十と鬼き蛇た 王おう馬ま, Tokita Ōma; "Ohma Tokita"), also known as The Asura (阿ア修シュ羅ラ, Ashura), is a man who loves to fight. He entered into the Kengan Association, fighting for the Nogi Group. During the Kengan Annihilation Tournament, Ohma fought for Yamashita Trading Co. with Yamashita Kazuo as his employer. Two years later, he entered the Kengan Association VS Purgatory Tournament as a representative for the Kengan Association.</p>

                <li><p>Ohma is a handsome tan-skinned man of above-average height and has an extremely athletic build. His most notable trait is his mop of messy, dark hair that has been compared to seaweed. In addition, Ohma possesses a narrow gaze that exudes both confidence and general indifference.</p></li>

                <li><p>
                    A defining trait of Ohma is his lust for battle; ever eager to fight against those who are strong. Despite this love for fighting, he will not fight those that refuse to fight him. Such was the case when Kazuo and his son had done so on separate occasions. That being said, he was also short-tempered and can be quite violent. He was willing to physically assault Nogi Hideki, his employer, when the latter refused to make him Nogi Group's representative fighter, before being stopped by Hatsumi Sen.

                <li><p>Left on his own for twelve years and without a name, the youth that would become Tokita Ohma did everything he could to survive the harsh reality that was The Inside. On one fateful day, the youth ran back to his residence after stealing from the yakuza. However, the yakuza came after him with one of their enforcers, Ando Jiro. Despite the youth's good showing, Ando proved to be the superior combatant. Seeing no other option, the youth grabbed Ando and jumped out of the building they were in, to Ando's horror. Impressed by his sheer resolve, the yakuza's other enforcer, Tokita Niko, saved the youth's life and offered to teach him his Niko Style. He also gave him the name "Tokita Ohma", derived from both the Tokita and Shichiohba Wards of The Inside, where he took residence at the border between.</p></li>
